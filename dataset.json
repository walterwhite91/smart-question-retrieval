Social media has transformed the landscape of political communication, often undermining the quality of democratic debate. Research from the Pew Research Center indicates that social media platforms are breeding grounds for misinformation and echo chambers, where users are only exposed to viewpoints that reinforce their preexisting beliefs. The quality of democratic discourse relies on the free exchange of diverse perspectives and accurate information. Studies have shown that exposure to diverse viewpoints and fact-based information fosters a more informed and engaged electorate. While, social media can enhance civic engagement and mobilize grassroots movements, these benefits are often overshadowed by the spread of misinformation and polarization. Some argue that, social media democratizes information dissemination and empowers marginalized voices. However, without adequate measures to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information being shared, these platforms can do more harm than good.",
